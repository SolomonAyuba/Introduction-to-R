## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Hands on Text Formatting

Some Examples:

```{r}
Single "* *" makes text *italic*
Doube "** **" makes text **BOLD**
Double "~~ ~~" ~~Strikes through~~ text
For superscript\^2
For links [Click This Link] (https://#)
```

## Components of an R Markdown File

Let’s load the tidyverse package and Titanic.csv file, we will insert a chunk at the start and call it ‘setup’. Since we don’t want this code or its output to show in the HTML document, we add an include = FALSE option after the chunk name ({r setup, include = FALSE}).

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
Titanicdata <- read.csv("Titanic.csv")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Customizing Chunk Output

Mid-Lesson Question: What happens if you use eval = FALSE and echo = FALSE? What is the dierence between this and include = FALSE? Create a chunk with {r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE},

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
head(Titanicdata)
```

eval = FALSE and echo = FALSE will neither run the code in the chunk, nor show the code in the knied document. The code chunk essentially doesn’t exist in the knied document as it was never run. Whereas include = FALSE will run the code and store the output for later use.

```{r include=FALSE}
head(TitanicData)
```
